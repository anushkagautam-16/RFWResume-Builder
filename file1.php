                <h2>What Is a Cover Letter?</h2> <br>

                    <div><p>A cover letter is an integral part of your job application, along with your resume. 
                        It’s designed to introduce you in a more personal way, complementing the contents of the resume/CV,
                         expanding on relevant skills and achievements, and highlighting a selection of your most prominent
                          accomplishments. <br>
                          How long should a cover letter be? Aim at 2–4 paragraphs within one page.<br>
                        Not many achievements or relevant experience to talk about yet? Don’t worry—read our dedicated guides </p>
                    </div>
                <h2>What Is the Purpose of a Cover Letter?</h2><br>

                    <div><p>A good cover letter persuades the employer your qualifications match their needs, plus:<br>
                               1.Shows you did research and take the job seriously.<br>
                               2.Proves you understand the challenges of the company.<br>
                               3.Reflects that your vision aligns with their goals.<br>
                               4.Presents how your skills and experience are a solution.<br>
                          Ultimately, a good cover letter should be all about “why should we hire you” and “what’s in it for us.” 
                          The winning tactic here is focusing on them, not just on you, which will ultimately make you stand out
                           from other applicants<br>
                          And that’s why it’s worth spending time writing a solid cover letter. </p>
                   </div>
                <h2>How to Write a Cover Letter?</h2>
                <div><p>You can start working on your cover letter right away as you follow our steps. Use this cover letter template,
                     or explore more cover letter samples here (we have one for most jobs and industries):</p>

                </div>
                <h3>1. Start With a Header</h3>
                <div><p>A professional cover letter opens with a header. Ideally, your cover letter header should be the same as
                     in your resume (for consistency), so feel free to use the same template. <br>
                      If you prefer to make the header of your cover letter from scratch, include the following contact information: <br>
                          1.Full name<br>2.Job title<br>3.Phone number<br>4.Email address</p>
                </div>
                <h3>2. Address the Reader</h3>
                <div><p>Once you’re done with the header, it’s time to mention the location and date of writing. <br>
                         Then, address your cover letter directly to the hiring manager like so:<br>
                          Dear Katherine,<br>Dear Ms. Smith,<br>Dear Mr. McConnor,<br>
                          According to studies, people respond actively to hearing/seeing their names—so use it in the cover
                           letter salutation. Look for the hiring manager's name by:<br>

                        Checking the job description<br>
                     Going to the company’s LinkedIn page (to look for the person responsible for uploading the job offer)<br>
                    If you can’t find the name by any means possible, opt for “Dear Hiring Manager.” Avoid starting your cover
                  letter with “To Whom It May Concern” like the plague. And if you’re not living in Victorian England, don’t
                   start a cover letter with “Dear Sir or Madam,” either. </p>
                </div>
                <h3>3. Make a Proper Introduction</h3>
                <div><p>Here’s the brutal truth: these few sentences at the beginning of your cover letter will determine whether
                     the hiring manager will read on. So you need to start your cover letter in a way that attracts and holds 
                     the reader’s interest.<br>
                    Here are several proven strategies for starting your cover letter: <br>
                    Highlight your achievements.<br>Display your passion and enthusiasm.<br>Drop names.<br>Do all the above.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>4. Explain Why You’re the Perfect Fit</h3>
                <div><p>The second paragraph (main body) of your cover letter has a couple of jobs to perform:<br>
                          Give the hiring manager what they’re looking for.<br>
                          Show that you’ll satisfy the company’s specific needs. <br>
                         Let’s look at the cover letter example from above to see how this could be done.<br>
                        Remember Jane, our digital marketing manager candidate? The XYZ company she applies to needs (based on the job ad):<br>
                               A savvy digital marketing manager (1)<br>
                              Someone who will supervise the development of their new online portal (2)</p>
                </div>
                <h3>5. Show Your Motivation to Join the Company</h3>
                <div><p>Your future employers have needs. If they’re willing to hire you, it’s because they think you’ll satisfy
                     those needs. But they also want you to enjoy working with them. That way, they know you’re more likely to 
                     stay with them for longer.<br>
                     The key to writing a perfect third paragraph of your cover letter is showing the hiring manager why you want
                      this job, not just any job. That’s particularly important for entry-level candidates—enthusiasm and passion 
                      help prove you'll hit the ground running.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>6. Close With a Promise</h3>
                <div><p>How to make the best cover letter ending? By providing value. <br>
                         The worst mistakes you can make in the final paragraph are:<br>
                         Coming off needy<br>Focusing on how much you want the job, not on what you have to offer<br>
                         Repeating the clichéd phrase, “Thank you for your consideration and your time”</p>
                </div>
                <h3>7. Stay Formal in the Closing Salutation</h3>
                <div><p>Once you’ve written the body of your cover letter, you just need to put a formal closing at the very end.
                     Write “Sincerely” and follow it with your full name. Adding your handwritten signature is optional
                      (recommended for more formal cover letters).<br>
                      If you’re not a fan of the well-worn “Sincerely,” feel free to use any of the following:<br>
                   Thank you,<br>Best regards,<br>Kind regards,<br>Respectfully yours,<br>With best regards,</p>
                </div>
                <h3>8. Add a Postscript</h3>
                <div><p>All of the above sections are must-haves in a good cover letter. But there’s one special trick you can
                     use—the postscript. Why is it so important? Because it’s like a magnet for the hiring manager’s eyes that 
                     screams: “you cannot miss this information.”<br>
                     Use the postscript to tell the hiring manager about something impressive about your career, even if it’s not
                      strictly related to the job opening. And say you’d be happy to provide them with more details if they find it 
                      interesting.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>9. Double-Check the Formatting</h3>
                <div><p>Before you hit send, make sure your cover letter formatting is intact. <br>
                     Here’s everything you need to know about how to format your cover letter:<br>
                     1. Choose a legible cover letter font like Arial or Garamond, and keep it between 10 and 12 points in font size.<br>
                     2.Set even margins on all sides—1-inch margins should be perfect.<br>
                     3.Left-align all your contents.<br>
                     4.Use double cover letter spacing between paragraphs and 1–1.15 between lines.<br>
                     5.Title your cover letter by JobTitle—CoverLetter—YourName.<br>
                     6.Let your cover letter layout stay intact en route to the recruiter by saving the file in PDF.</p>
                </div>
