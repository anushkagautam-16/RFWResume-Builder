                <h2>What is a cover letter?</h2><br>
                <div><p>A cover letter is a formal letter that accompanies a CV or a resume. It includes a candidate’s introduction
                     and an overview of the candidate’s qualifications, skills, and accomplishments most relevant to the job they’re
                      pursuing. The cover letter also serves to express the candidate’s interest in the position and the company,
                       as well as eagerness to contribute to the company’s success. It can also help to explain employment gaps.</p>

                <h2>Is a cover letter necessary?</h2>
                <div><p>Yes.<br>
                           Almost half of the recruiters reject applications without a cover letter. Cover letters are a treat for those who 
                           still care to hire dedicated professionals. (And that’s you, right?)<br>
                           It’s no surprise, though, that you’re questioning whether a cover letter is necessary. The entire job application 
                           process can be exhausting, so cutting down on documents you have to produce always seems like a good idea.
                           But not this time.</p>
