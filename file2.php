                 <div style="margin-left:180px;margin-right:180px;padding:80px;">
                    <h2 style="text-align:center;">1. Choose the Right Resume Format</h2>
                    <p>First, you need to take care of the canvas before painting your application. It’ll help you organize your resume;
                         recruiters will bid in interviews when they see your craftsmanship. <br>
                           There are three resume formats:</p>
                        <div>
                            <img src="Images/btn1img1.jpg" width=780px height=700px style="margin-left:50px;">
                        </div>
                    <p>A chronological resume has a classic resume layout, emphasizing your work experience and professional 
                        accomplishments. It lists your work history in reverse order, from the most current going backward. It’s 
                        the most popular among all-level candidates and recruiters, and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) can read it,
                         too. </p>
                    <p>A functional resume puts greater emphasis on your skills and qualities, hence the secondary name, skills-based
                         resume. The most important resume section is the skills summary, whereas your work history takes a back seat.
                          Use it for your creative resume or when transitioning to civilian with a military resume.<br>
                          Lastly, a combination resume that’s a hybrid of the two. It highlights your experience and skill set.
                           It’s best for professionals with plenty of relevant experience to show off. But, it’s also a good choice 
                           for career change resumes and covering employment gaps if you wish to do so.<br>
                        Is there any safe bet? Yes, there is—the chronological resume. (This guide is based on that particular format.)
                         See what it looks like:</p>
                         <div>
                            <img src="Images/btn1img2.jpg" width=780px height=700px style="margin-left:50px;">
                         </div>
                    <p>Here are the formatting rules for creating a chronological resume template:<br>
                         <b>Technicalities:</b><br>
                          <ul><li>Create even margins on your resume. 1-inch on all sides.</li>
                          <li>Set a legible resume font for the text, like Arial, Calibri, or Verdana, in 10–12 pts.
                           For headings, use 13–14 pts in font size.</li>
                          <li>Use single or 1.15 line spacing. And add an extra line before and after a heading.</li>
                          <li>Exceed a resume’s page limit only when unavoidable. Stick to one page for the best results.</li></ul></p>
                    <p><b>Sectioning:</b><br>
                        <ul><li>Start with a resume header. Make it distinctive to highlight your name and contact information.</li>
                        <li>Organize your resume sections in the following order: summary/objective, work experience, education, skills, and extras.</li>
                        <li>Use bullet points for your entries under each section.</li>
                        <li>Find resume icons for each section or skip them altogether.</li></ul></p>
                    <p><b>File format:</b><br>
                      <ul><li>See what the job ad says. Look for a preferred file formatting (PDF or .docx) in the job description. </li>
                          <li>If the company asks to send resumes in Microsoft Word .docx format, creating your resume in Word and 
                            sending it as required is a good idea.</li>
                          <li>Format your resume in PDF if there’s no requirement in the ad for your content to stay intact.
                             PDFs preserve the structure and formatting on all devices.</li>
                          <li>Name your resume file by including the job title first, then the word resume, and lastly, your full name,
                             separated by hyphens or underscores—for example, accountant-resume-jane-doe.pdf.</li></ul></p>
                 </div>
                 <div style="margin-left:180px;margin-right:180px;padding:80px;">
                    <h2 style="text-align:center;">2. Add Your Contact Information and Personal Details</h2>
                    <p>A career diplomat knows what information to disclose and which is better to hold back. Likewise, there are basic
                         items that you must include in the contact information section, but you should also know what not to put on a
                          resume:</p>
                         <h3>Contact Information to Include</h3>
                         <ul><li><b>Name:</b> First name, last name.</li>
                         <li><b>Job title:</b> The one you currently have or the most recent one.</li>
                         <li><b>Phone number:</b> Personal cell phone rather than the home phone number.</li>
                         <li><b>Email address:</b> Today's preferred means of communication.</li>
                         <li><b>LinkedIn URL:</b> Include your LinkedIn profile (hiring managers will look you up anyway).</li></ul></p>
                    <p><h3>Contact Information to Leave Out</h3>
                         <ul><li><b>Date of birth:</b> Adding your birthdate could lead to ageism. Add only if required, such as for 
                         jobs serving alcohol, for example.</li>
                         <li><b>Second email or phone number:</b> A second email address, mailing address, or phone number will just 
                            confuse them (and you).</li>
                         <li><b>Photo/headshot:</b> In the United States, photos are acceptable only for jobs where appearance is part of it,
                             like acting or modeling.</li></ul>
                        <h3>Optional Contact Information</h3>
                        <ul><li><b>Home address:</b> Leave your address off your resume unless it’s required.</li>
                            <li><b>Resume title:</b> Your summary or objective would cover that part.</li>
                            <li><b>Personal website:</b> They’re becoming increasingly popular for creatives or jobs in information
                             technology. </li></ul></p>
